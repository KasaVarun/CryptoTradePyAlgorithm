## Introduction

Cryptocurrencies have captured the interest of individuals and major financial institutions alike, leading to a dynamic and often volatile market. This project leverages the capabilities of Python to create an automated trading solution that employs algorithmic strategies. The use of SMAs as a basis for trading decisions allows for the exploration of trends and potential profit opportunities in the cryptocurrency market.

## Features

- **Algorithmic Trading**: Automate trading decisions using algorithmic strategies, saving time and effort for traders.
- **Simple Moving Averages**: Implement trading strategies based on simple moving averages (SMAs) to identify potential market trends.
- **Customization**: Easily configure and adjust trading parameters through the `config.json` file.
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Utilize historical cryptocurrency data to backtest and analyze the performance of algorithmic strategies.
- **User-Friendly**: The project's structure and codebase are designed to be beginner-friendly, enabling traders of varying skill levels to engage.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/KasaVarun/CryptoTradePyAlgorithm.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd CryptoTradePyAlgorithm
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Adjust configuration settings in the `config.json` file to suit your trading preferences.

2. Run the main script to initiate the algorithmic trading:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

3. The algorithm will process historical cryptocurrency data, generate trading signals based on the selected SMA strategy, and execute trades accordingly.

## Configuration

Customize trading settings by modifying the `config.json` file. Adjust parameters such as trading pairs, SMA intervals, risk management, and more.

## Output

Analyze the generated output to understand the performance of the algorithmic trading strategy. The output may include trading logs, profit/loss reports, and other relevant metrics.
